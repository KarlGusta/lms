# Leave Management System
Leave management system is a system used by employees to request for leave, and for their leave to be approved by their superiors.

## Tools used
- Apache Tomcat v9.0
- I am using the `layout-combo.html` which is a template from Tabler. I have already created a template that I will use when starting a new page. I have named it `My template for this and other projects too.jsp`.

## The design

This is the system design that I am using for this project.
